# Course Assignment Simulator
### Python / Dash App to simulate, visualize and ultimately solve rule-based course allocation problems.
-------------
**Overview**<br />
This app can be used to simulate course allocations via user-definable rulesets. <br />
Assignement data must be imported first and can be done in many ways through the use of mapping files.<br />
The course assignment simulator was created for my masters thesis at HTW Berlin.<br />
