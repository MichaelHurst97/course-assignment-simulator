**Overview**<br />
This app is used to simulate course allocations via user-definable rulesets. <br />
Assignment data must be imported first and can be done in many ways through the use of mapping files.<br />
Assignment data is imported and stored in SQLite files. Simulation stats, rulesets and user settings as JSON.<br />
The course assignment simulator was created for my masters thesis at and for HTW Berlin.<br />
